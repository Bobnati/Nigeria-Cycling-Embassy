      <p>It is one of the hottest questions in the Global cycling community.
      Should cyclists wear bicycle helmets? Let's talk about this head-breaking (pun intended) topic.
      By the end of this article, you should have all the wisdom you need to answer that question and unlock the true superpowers of the bicycle helmet.</p>

      <p>Unlike those gas-guzzling metal beasts (yeah, cars, we are looking at you), bicycles can be viewed as the ultimate eco-friendly chariots of the modern age.
      But, let's not skate around the potential hazards. Our trusty two-wheeled friends are vulnerable, especially when it comes to sharing the road with those four-wheeled giants.
      The threat of unwanted incidents is real, especially in the chaos of ever-busy Nigerian roads.</p>

      <p>Now, here's where helmets swoop in to save the day, like superheroes.
      No one plans for accidents; however, they happen anyway.
      The human body is almost like a fragile treasure chest; even slight knocks can cause problems in some parts of the body, such as the head and around the joints.
      Bicycle helmets function as magical protection shields.
      Think of them as armor that guides your precious body tissues in the case of an unwanted incident.</p>

      <img src="white-helmet.jpg" >

      <p>A jaw-dropping 85% of head injuries during bike accidents could have been avoided if the cyclist were wearing helmets.
      Quite simply, helmets protect!
      Helmets may not be the ultimate crash protection amulet or even a crash avoidance talisman.
      They will, however, minimize impact and save something.
      A helmet can mean the difference between a few days of headaches and brain surgery after an accident!</p>

      <p>In conclusion, my helmet heroes, the bicycle helmet is our shield, seatbelt, and airbag as we ride.
      And let's admit, they look cool too.</p>

      <p> Don't they? Now go forth and get your bike helmet before you ride.</p>
