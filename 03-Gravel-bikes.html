        <p>GRAVEL BIKES - Best of both worlds?</p>

            <p>So.... you're a biking enthusiast torn between a road bike and an mountain bike.  
            Maybe your area has the same amount of off-road as it has main roads and you are unsure which bike to buy. 
            Well, fret not!
              The gravel bike comes to the rescue, solving the age-long dilemma of two different biking worlds. I mean... 
            Why buy two separate bikes when you can have the best of both worlds in a single ride?</p>
      


            <p class="subHeadings2" > A gravel bike, also known as a hybrid bike, adventure bike or all-road bike, 
              is a versatile type of bicycle designed for riding on a variety of surfaces and conditions,
               including main roads, off-road on sand and other rough trails and more..just name it. </p>

            <p class="subHeadings2">  Gravel bikes have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to handle a 
               wide range of terrain and provide a comfortable and efficient riding experience. 
               Think of them as the Jeep and SUVs of the cycling world...</p>

            <p class="subHeadings2">It's like having the speed of a road bike and the rugged strength of a mountain bike -
               in one sleek ride.</p>
     
       <h3>Cons of Gravel Bikes </h3>
          <h4>Masters Of Versatility</h4>
            <p class="subHeadings2"> Gravel Bikes aren't picky.  They can make you feel at home both on the smooth main roads 
              and in off-road conditions. 
            No terrain is off-limits for the gravel bike. They are deisgned to be fully customisable to fit the 
            preferences of the rider. 
            You can call them the chameleon of the biking world, 
            adapting to any surroundings with nothing more than little adjustments here and there.</p>

          <p class="subHeadings1"> Structure of the Frame</p>
          <div class="wrapImages">
            <img src="customisable-frames.jpg" alt="customisable bike frame">
          </div>
          <p>
           Although they are meant to have fully customisable frames;
           Gravel bikes typically have a more relaxed and comfortable frame geometry compared to road racing bikes.
           This design allows for a more upright riding position, enhancing comfort during long rides.</p>

    
          <p class="subHeadings1"> Tire Clearance </p>
          <div class="wrapImages">
            <img src="drop-bar-with-big-tires.jpg" alt="gravel bike with big tires">
          </div>
          <p class="subHeadings2">
            Gravel bikes have more tire clearance or tire space for their frames, so you can install
             bigger tires if you ride
            more in off-road conditions or if you just like them big.. <br> hmm...<br> ok back to business..<br> 
          </p>
            <p> The wider tire clearance on the frame/fork, 
            enables the riders to use larger tires with more significant tread if they need to for example,
            improve traction and stability on rough and uneven surfaces. In addition, Gravel bike tires are usually wider 
            than those found on traditional road bikes, often ranging from 28mm to 45mm or even wider. 
            The added tire width provides better control and shock absorption on gravel and off-road terrain. 
           If you however prefer thinner tires, you can always remove the bigger ones on the bike and install them.
             The flexibility of the gravel bike is unmatched!</p>

             <p class="subHeadings2"> Most gravel bikes come equipped with disc brakes, 
              which offer superior stopping power and control, 
              especially in wet or muddy conditions.</p>

             <p class="subHeadings1"> Drop Handlebars </p> 
             <p class="subHeadings2">Gravel bikes typically feature drop handlebars, similar to road bikes,
               allowing for multiple hand positions. 
               This design helps riders maintain control and comfort during long rides. </p>

              </div>
               
               <p class="subHeadings1">Mounting Points </p>
                <p class="subHeadings2">Gravel bikes are equipped with numerous mounting points for accessories
                   such as racks, fenders, lights, water bottle cages, and bags. 
                   This makes them really suitable for
                    bike-packing, touring and long-distance rides
                     as you can take important bike tools and components with you on your rides. </p>

                <h3> Gearing </h3>

                <p class="subHeadings2"> Gravel bikes often come with a wide range of gears,
                   including lower gears for climbing steep gravel hills and
                    higher gears for faster road sections. This is so that the bike mantains
                     its performance in a wide array of terrains.</p>
                     <div class="wrapImages">
                      <img src="large-group-set.jpg" alt="big array of gears">
                     </div>
  

    
            <p class="subHeadings1">Cons of Gravel Bikes</p>
            
            <p class="subHeadings1">Usually Heavier</p>
            
            <p class="subHeadings2">Gravel bikes usually come with a little extra weight compared to their road counterparts.
            The possibilities of flexibility mean that they have to be fitted with very parts 
            that should work with a variety of other parts and in many different conditions. This means for example that strong and heavy
            frame materials will be used that can tolerate heavier tires and bigger loads, such as steel or aluminum frames,
            which adds to the weight of the bike.</p>
            
            <p class="subHeadings1">Reduced Specialization</p>
            <p class="subHeadings2">While they've got the flexibility to be pretty much anything a bike can be, or anything 
              the rider wants the bike to be,
            gravel bikes still bow to the superior speed of road bikes and the immense comfortability and hill climbing capabilities that
            mountain bikes have. If you know the conditions you will be doing most of your riding in, it is much better to go for
            a roadie or a mountain bike from the start.</p>

            <p>
              And there you have it, gravel bikes are one of the most handy bikes to have because you can ride 
              them pretty much anywhere with only a few tweaks. </p>
              <p> Do you have a gravel bike?
