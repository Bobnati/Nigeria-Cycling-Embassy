<p>At Nigeria Cycling Embassy(NCE), our mission is to promote a cleaner, greener, healthier 
and a more sustainable environment, both in the urban and the rural landscapes of Nigeria. 
NCE, through the promotion of alternative transport methods -most important of them, cycling- seeks to improve 
the quality of Nigerians by encouraging active lifestyles, promote sustainable transport infrastructure and
 awareness of sustainable transport throughout the community while improving the environmental and social quality of Nigeria. </p>

<p>In addition, by providing adequate education for all our end users which range from policy makers
     to seasoned and occasional cyclists, we assist them in making informed decisions in line with SDG
      4 which is quality education. </p>

<p>NCE also promotes employment opportunities by facilitating and promoting green logistics transport through 
    the bicycle courier services model, cycling tourism and so on. </p>

<p>Lastly and most importantly, by encouraging people to ride their bikes we promote sustainable 
lifestyle practices that increase the incidence of a variety of diseases that range from obesity 
to diabetes to cardiovascular diseases while reducing the emission of greenhouse gases that 
contribute to climate change in line with SDG 3 and SDG 13 respectively. </p>


<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>The core solution that Nigeria Cycling embassy is providing is to address an imperative 
and pressing need for sustainable urban transport solutions in Nigeria. 
Rapid urbanisation poses significant challenges in Nigeria, particularly in the predominantly
 urban states like Lagos, Port-Harcourt, Abuja and so on. Some of these problems include 
 increased traffic congestion that waste crucial productive hours, air pollution that have the
  potential to cause chronic health problems, and environmental degradation. 
  These problems cumulatively reduce the quality of life drastically. 
  NCE primarily seeks to plug this gap.</p>

<p>By promoting and equipping Nigerians with the right knowledge and equipment to begin incorporating cycling
 into their daily lifestyles and as alternative forms of transport many of these urban challenges 
 can be effectively addressed. </p>



<p>In summary, our mission is simple: Get as many Nigerians on their bike as possible.</p>
