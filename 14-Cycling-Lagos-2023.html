  <p>The Lagos State Sports Commission has promised to provide for all the technical
     aspects that will be in need for the event as the director of the commission noted.</p>

<div>
  <p>The winner and first runner-up of the first edition,
     Quadri Ajebadi and Afeez Bakare respectively are not expected to defend their titles 
     this year which may present newer chances for cyclists all over the state and country to grab
      the opportunity to establish themselves in the Nigeria cycling space.</p>

<p> As usual, Nigeria Cycling Embassy will be publishing tips to make sure that 
    you are fully prepared to take the opportunity present in this event.</p>
