<p>To be honest... when it comes to night-time cycling in Nigeria, 
  there's just nothing like it. Picture this: cruising through the moonlit streets (NEPA side eye..),
  and embracing the cool night breeze. </p>

<p>Then something interrupts that lovely imagination...
  <br>
  <br>
   The inevitable portholes that fill our Nigerian roads...lol... You see,
    in the absence of something to navigate those road bumps that have become such a normal thing on our roads,
    <s>no</s> thanks to our government... 
    it's like trying to eat rice straight from the bag without boiling it.
     Not exactly good news for your teeth..
     right? 
     <br>
     <br>
     It is the same way these holesüï≥Ô∏è are not too good for our wrists...
    </p> 

<p>
However.. here comes the saviour... Your Headlight, steps in with a confidence that even
 Chris Froome would envy...wink! 

    Do you need to see where you're headed and avoid those trademark portholes of Nigerian road? 
    Check!

     Need other road users to bask in your radiant presence? Double-check. </p>
     <div class="wrapImages">

</div>
    
 <p> Now, let's get down to business why are these luminous sidekicks such a big deal? 
    Well, besides giving you the power to spot those ever present portholes from a mile away, 
    they're practically your guardian angels, reducing the risk of any unwanted incident by a whopping 60%.</p>
    
   <p> Oh, and the confidence boost? It's real
     With your trusty headlight leading the way,
    you'll ride with the swagger of a two-wheeled rockstar.
     And let's not forget the VIP treatment you'll get from fellow road users who can spot you from afar.
      It's like screaming "Admire the incoming Nigerian Cyclist" </p>
    
    <p>So, before you pedal off on your next epic ride across the Nigerian cycle space, 
    remember the golden rule: Attach your headlight to your bike before you start riding.</p>
