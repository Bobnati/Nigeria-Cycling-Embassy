    <h1>Reflective Clothing</h1>
   

   <p class="subHeadings2"> Ever heard of reflective clothing? It's like having your own personal spotlight on the road, 
    and trust us, it's a game-changer. Let's dive into the awesomeness!</p>
    
    <p class="subHeadings1"> THE CYCLIST'S GLOW-UP</p>
    <p class="subHeadings2">So, you know how cars have those large steel cans and fancy exhausts that scream, 
    'Hey, I'm here!' Bicycles, well, are a bit more modest. 
    Bikes are relatively small and rely on the ever quiet pedal power 
    (except if someone has not been lubricating 
    their bike parts). So how do we make our presence known on the road?
    Well, here is where our reflective clothing heroes come to the rescue!</p>
   
    <p class="subHeadings2">
    Reflective clothing is like having a superpower cloak. 
    One fact about the roads is that most accidents happen because of one pesky thing:
     poor visibility. A large part of collisions and can be avoided if there was just
     5 seconds earlier visibility.
      But fear not, reflective clothing swoops in like a superhero sidekick, 
     making sure you're seen and safe.
    This cyclist cloak is designed to catch beams of light and throw them right back to where they came from.
     Result? You're suddenly super visible, even if you ride the smallest BMX or foldable bike
      especially in poor visibiity conditions. Such as in the rain, fog or at night. </p>
    
    <p class="subHeadings2">
    Picture this: You, cruising down the road, decked out in your reflective gear. 
    Those headlights from other vehicles? They bounce right back, making you unmissable. 
    It's like your own personal light show.</p>
      
          <blockquote class="proTip">
              <p class="subHeadings2">"Check the quality of the reflective material. 
                High-quality reflective clothing will be more effective at reflecting light 
                even at farther distances and will last longer"
               </p>
          </blockquote>
      
    
    
    
   <p class="subHeadings2">
    Whether you're a moonlight pedal pusher or braving the bustling city streets,
     reflective clothing is your secret weapon. Don that reflective vest,
      throw on those glow-in-the-dark threads, and ride with confidence.</p>
    
    <p class="subHeadings2">So, my fellow riders, the verdict is in: 
    Reflective clothing is one of the MVPs of road cycling safety.
     Sp shine on, pedal pros!" </p>
