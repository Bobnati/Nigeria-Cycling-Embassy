    <h1>Reflective Stickers</h1>

    <p class="subHeadings2"> So you don't like the idea of reflective vests
        or you like them but want to take this visibilty thing further?
         Well you have come to the right place. Nigeria Cycling Embassy accept all cyclists
         including the ones who believe there no such thing as "too much safety."</p>
         
    <p class="subHeadings2">So.. lets reflect..em on Reflective stickers... these bits of material
         are here to turn your bike into a star..literally, 
    even without the glitz and glam of actual lights. 
    Let's uncover the magic of these luminous gems!</p>
    
    <p class="subHeadings1">LIGHT UP YOUR RIDE</p>
   <p class="subHeadings2"> Reflective stickers are basically like reflective <a href="12-Reflective-Clothing.html">vests</a> 
    but instead of you wearing them, they are directly applied on your bike frame. 
    Reflective stickers are like your bike's own secret language with light.
     They're like little mirrors that play catch and throw back with the light beams around them.
      Result? Your bike -and you- shine like a beacon in the night.</p>
    
    <p class="subHeadings1"> LIGHT ON THE POCKET </p>
    <p class="subHeadings2">We get it, not everyone's got a superhero budget. Reflective vests are cheap
        but maybe you will still pass on parting with that 3 or 5k. 
     Reflective stickers swoop in to save the day with a cost-effective glow-up.
      You don't need a fortune to make your bike still stand out in the dark.</p>
    
    <p class="subHeadings1"> STICK 'EM ANYWHERE</p>
    <p class="subHeadings2">Flat surface? Check. Wood, plastic, glass?
     Check, check, check. Just keep checking.. and shining..
     Reflective stickers are like chameleons â€“ they blend in anywhere.
      Stick 'em on your bike, helmet, or gear, and they will work just as well.</p>
    
    <p class="subHeadings1"> Available 24/7 </p>
    <p class="subHeadings2">Ever had that 'Oops, forgot my reflective clothing' moment? 
        And you havent even gotten to your destination but you
        already have anxiety for your return trip..yeah I have been there too.
        
        Reflective stickers, however, will always have your back. 
        They're always on duty, pasted on your bike,
         making sure you're seen, day or night. Well except you peeled them off..
         in which case, what were you thinking not getting a replacement?</p>
    
 <p class="subHeadings1">Safe AND Stylish</p>
 <p class="subHeadings2"> You don't need a fashion degree to rock reflective stickers. 
    They're not just safety superstars; they're also your bike's new favorite accessory.
    
    So, fellow riders, if you want to be the talk of the town without saying a word,
    slap on those creative reflective stickers and let the your bike make heads roll!</p>
