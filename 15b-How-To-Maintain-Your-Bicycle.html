    <p>
        In this article, we are going to continue to share how you can
         improve the lifespan of your bicycle while keeping it sparkly shiny and clean.
    </p>

 
<li> <h4>  Inspect Your Bearings </h4>
    <p>Your bearings are the boiler plate on which your other bike parts like the wheels, move. 
        They should be in top shape to ensure everything is moving seamlessly. 
 
        Give the bearings between your pedals ( called the bottom bracket), and hubs a gentle spin or shake. 
If they're grinding like a rusty old windmill, it may be time to change them. 
Your bottom bracket also should not feel loose or shake when your toggle it from side to side.

If it does.. well.. you know what I will say next...

Check the bearings in the headset and hubs for smooth rotation.
Consider repacking them with fresh grease, if your bike has seen better days, but usually they will be fine.

With bearings that spin as smooth as butter, your bike will glide like it's on a cloud, and you should be able to 
free-wheel for longer. If your bike is always eager to grind to a stop the moment you stop your pedalling it might
be time to check out your bearings.

<li> <h4> Tighten Bolts </h4> 
    <p> This is a similar tip to the frame inspection. However, we felt it should have a seperate section 
        because it is equally as important.
        
        Every so often, give the bolts, screws and nuts on your bike a little love tap, 
        especially the ones holding your stem, handlebars, and seat post. 
        We don't want them coming loose like that apala music band on your birthday mornings as a surprise! </p>
        
       <p> Bicycle bolts usually should stay strong, but if for some reason like rust or 
        a mechanic error, your bolts feel undertightened or overtightened bolt, adjust them as necessary.

        Bear in mind that over-tightened bolts are prone to breakage.
        Loose bolts are even worse as they can fall off and fail. </p>
        
        <p>With proper inspections, your bolts should remain snug as bugs in a rug, 
        you'll ride with the confidence knowing your bike is in excellent condition.
        </p> 
    </li>


<li> <h4> Replace Cables and Housing </h4>
    <p> Over time, cables and housing can wear out. 
        Replace them when they become frayed or corroded. </p> 
    </li>

<li> <h4> Safety Check </h4>
    <p> Before each ride, perform a quick safety check, 
        including checking that your brakes are working properly, 
        tires are adequately inflated, and all components are secure. </p>
     </li>

<li> <h4> Store Properly </h4> 
    <p>Store your bike in a dry, cool place,
         away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.
          Use a bike cover if storing outdoors. </p> 
    </li>

<li> <h4> Seek Professional Help </h4>
    <p> If you're unsure about any maintenance tasks
         or if your bike requires major repairs, 
         take it to a professional bike shop for servicing. </p> 
    </li>
